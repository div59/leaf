	  <p>What are the symptoms ?<br>
<br/> Cause of disease:
    <br/><br/> 1. Powdery mildew infections favor humid conditions with temperatures around 68-81Â° F
        <br/> 2. In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease.
        <br/> 3. Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer in Minnesota.  The older leaves are more susceptible and powdery mildew will infect them first.
        <br/> 4. Wind blows spores produced in leaf spots to infect other leaves.
        <br/> 5. Under favorable conditions, powdery mildew can spread very rapidly, often covering all of the leaves.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.
        <br/>2. Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.
        
        <br/>3. Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.
        <br/>4. If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.
