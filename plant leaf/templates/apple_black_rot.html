	  <p>What are the symptoms ?<br>
<br/> Cause of disease:
     <br/><br/>Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time.	Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.
        <br/>2. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation.
        
        <br/>3. High risk factors for grey leaf spot in corn: <br/>
                    a.	Susceptible hybrid
                    b.	Continuous corn
                    c.	Late planting date
                    d.	Minimum tillage systems
                    e.	Field history of severe disease
                    f.	Early disease activity (before tasseling)
                    g.	Irrigation
                    h.	Favorable weather forecast for disease.</p>
<p>
<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li> Eliminate initial source of infection by removing infected plant debris and weeds, and use disease-free seeds.</li>
    <li> If complete removal of plant debris is not possible, destroy by deep plowing immediately after harvest and follow with a one-year rotation with non-solanaceous crop.</li>
    <li>Clean the area of any diseased plants and debris to help prevent Septoria leaf spot.</li>
    <li>Overwatering your plants will help the disease spread.</li>
    <li> Leave space between your plants to ensure good air circulation. </li>
