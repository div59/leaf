	  <p>What are the symptoms ?<br>
<br/> Cause of disease:
      <br/><br/> 1. The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops.
        <br/> 2. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions.
        <br/> 3. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. 
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
        <br/>2. Do not over-fertilize
        
        <br/>3. Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.

<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li> Eliminate initial source of infection by removing infected plant debris and weeds, and use disease-free seeds.</li>
    <li> If complete removal of plant debris is not possible, destroy by deep plowing immediately after harvest and follow with a one-year rotation with non-solanaceous crop.</li>
    <li>Clean the area of any diseased plants and debris to help prevent Septoria leaf spot.</li>
    <li>Overwatering your plants will help the disease spread.</li>
    <li> Leave space between your plants to ensure good air circulation. </li>
