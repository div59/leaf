	  <p>What are the symptoms of Peach Bacterial spot?<br>
Leaf yellowing and shot holes due to bacterial spot, with relatively clean fruit. 
You can identify Peach Bacterial spot spot by its characteristics:

    <li> Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (XAP), formerly Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. </li>
    <li>The diseaseâ€™s symptoms include fruit spots, leaf spots and twig cankers.</li>
    <li>Leaf tip yellowing and flecked fruit due to bacterial spot.</li>
	<li> Leaf yellowing and shot holes due to bacterial spot, with relatively clean fruit</li>
    <li>Severe leaf spot infections can cause early defoliation. </li>
    <!--<li>Young fruit that is infected often drops to the ground early</li>
    <li>Mature fruit that was infected at harvest may develop apple scab in storage</li>-->
</p>
<p>
<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li> the best strategy is to use cultivars with better bacterial spot resistance.</li>
    <li> Compounds available for use on peach and nectarine for bacterial spot include copper, oxytetracycline (Mycoshield and generic equivalents), and syllit+captan; however, repeated applications are typically necessary for even minimal disease control.</li>
    <li>Syllit+captan is used as a moderately effective alternative to oxytetracycline, but with some risk of phytotoxicity if used repeatedly without intervening rains. </li>
    <li>We avoid the use of spray additives such as foliar nutrients, and any surfactants with penetrating characteristics when applying syllit + captan.</li>
    <li> Copper provides a third alternative for bacterial spot control where needed but with a somewhat greater risk of phytotoxicity. </li>
