apple scab shows up as spots on green apples

Apple scab on apples

You can identify apple scab by its characteristics:

    <li>Circular spots are light brown and start to appear on fruit and leaves in early spring</li>
    <li>Scabs are sunken, up to ¾” around, dark brown, and make spores in their center</li>
    <li>Leaves and fruit are affected, often leaves around
	<li>developing fruit, and at the blossom end of young fruit</li>
     Deformed, twisted leaves</li>
    <li>Cracked skin on fruit</li>
    <li>Young fruit that is infected often drops to the ground early</li>
    <li>Mature fruit that was infected at harvest may develop apple scab in storage</li>
</p>

        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. Apple scab overwinters primarily in fallen leaves and in the soil. Disease development is favored by wet, cool weather that generally occurs in spring and early summer.
        <br/> 2. Fungal spores are carried by wind, rain or splashing water from the ground to flowers, leaves or fruit. During damp or rainy periods, newly opening apple leaves are extremely susceptible to infection. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more severe the infection will be. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees Fahrenheit.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Choose resistant varieties when possible.
        <br/>2. Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring
        
        <br/>3. Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
        <br/>4. Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
