	  <h3>Accuracy is: {{r}}%</h3>
	  <p>What are the symptoms ?<br>
<br/> Cause of disease:
      <br/><br/>Podosphaera clandestina, a fungus that most commonly infects young, expanding leaves but can also be found on buds, fruit and fruit stems. It overwinters as small, round, black bodies (chasmothecia) on dead leaves, on the orchard floor, or in tree crotches. Colonies produce more (asexual) spores generally around shuck fall and continue the disease cycle.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Remove and destroy sucker shoots.
        <br/>2. Keep irrigation water off developing fruit and leaves by using irrigation that does not wet the leaves. Also, keep irrigation sets as short as possible.
        
        <br/>3. Follow cultural practices that promote good air circulation, such as pruning, and moderate shoot growth through judicious nitrogen management.

<p>
<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li> Eliminate initial source of infection by removing infected plant debris and weeds, and use disease-free seeds.</li>
    <li> If complete removal of plant debris is not possible, destroy by deep plowing immediately after harvest and follow with a one-year rotation with non-solanaceous crop.</li>
    <li>Clean the area of any diseased plants and debris to help prevent Septoria leaf spot.</li>
    <li>Overwatering your plants will help the disease spread.</li>
    <li> Leave space between your plants to ensure good air circulation. </li>
