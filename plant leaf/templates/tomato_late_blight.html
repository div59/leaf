	  <p>What are the symptoms ?<br>
<br/> Cause of disease:
      <br/><br/> 1. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.
        <br/> 2. There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.
        <br/> 3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.

<p>
<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li> Eliminate initial source of infection by removing infected plant debris and weeds, and use disease-free seeds.</li>
    <li> If complete removal of plant debris is not possible, destroy by deep plowing immediately after harvest and follow with a one-year rotation with non-solanaceous crop.</li>
    <li>Clean the area of any diseased plants and debris to help prevent Septoria leaf spot.</li>
    <li>Overwatering your plants will help the disease spread.</li>
    <li> Leave space between your plants to ensure good air circulation. </li>
