	  <p>What are the symptoms of Tomato Early blight?<br>
Early blight is one of the most common tomato diseases, occurring nearly every season in Minnesota.
You can identify Tomato Early blight by its characteristics:

    <li> It affects leaves, fruits and stems and can be severely yield-limiting when susceptible tomato cultivars are used and weather is favorable.</li>
    <li>Severe defoliation can occur.  In tomatoes, fruit can be damaged by sun.</li>
    <li>Initially, small dark spots form on older foliage near the ground. Leaf spots are round, brown and can grow up to 1/2 inch in diameter.</li>
	<li>Larger spots have target-like concentric rings. The tissue around spots often turns yellow.</li>
    <li>Severely infected leaves turn brown and fall off, or dead, dried leaves may cling to the stem.</li>
    <!--<li>Young fruit that is infected often drops to the ground early</li>
    <li>Mature fruit that was infected at harvest may develop apple scab in storage</li>-->
</p>
<p>
<center><b>GENERAL PREVENTION MEASURES<b></center>

    <li>Use pathogen-free seed, or collect seed only from disease-free plants.</li>
    <li>Rotate out of tomatoes and related crops for at least two years.</li>
    <li>Control susceptible weeds such as black nightshade and hairy nightshade, and volunteer tomato plants throughout the rotation.</li>
    <li>Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus.</li>
    <li>Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry.</li>
